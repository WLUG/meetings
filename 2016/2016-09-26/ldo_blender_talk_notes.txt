15-minute Blender intro

Blender covers all the major areas of computer graphics production:
modelling, rendering, animation, physical simulation, compositing, even
video editing. Also has a game engine. Plus of course Python scriptability
integrated throughout. And now the Grease Pencil has become more than
just a tool for making proofing marks, it is also a drawing and animation
tool now.

Use my “Raumschiff Orion” .blend file to show off simple camera
animation. Then use it to show off drawing in 3D with grease pencil,
including pressure sensitivity and animation (just a couple of frames
at different times).

Also show off sculpt mode with dyntopo.
