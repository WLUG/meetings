Brief intro to making music/audio

Introduce JACK, explain that MIDI is just control signals, not sound
(very old standard, from 1980s, 16-channel limit, but never been
supplanted by anything more advanced).

Start JACK. Show connections window, explain the 3 tabs, 2 different
kinds of MIDI (“ALSA” vs “MIDI”--latter is JACK-native).

Show QJackCtl setup with my pajackconnect script to interoperate
with PulseAudio. Mention a2jmidid to offer compatibility between the
2 kinds of MIDI APIs.

Show simple connection between keyboard and sound source (e.g. QSynth/FluidSynth).
Show my Korg with USB-MIDI adapter.

Mention “General MIDI”, which is a minimal instrument set and default
channel layout (drum kit on channel 10) to allow some predictability
in being able to interchange simple MIDI files.

Load the Gershwin Prelude Number 2 into Rosegarden; show it in Notation
and Matrix editors; connect to FluidSynth and play some of it.
