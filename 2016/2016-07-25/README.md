Meeting 2016-07-25
==================

[X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System), the most common [display server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_server) on Linux, is showing its age. Newcomers, like [Wayland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)) and [Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_(software)) are trying to address shortcomings and provide a basis for the future.

**Ian Young** will also demo [Endless OS](https://endlessm.com/), an operating system that "comes with
everything your family needs".
