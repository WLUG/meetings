Create RAID-1 array with one disk partition and one USB stick partition.

Init filesystem and mount volume. Put file on volume. Perhaps compute SHA-256
hash with sha256sum and store that somewhere as well.

After syncing has finished, pull out USB stick.

Demonstrate file still accessible, by recomputing SHA-256 hash and comparing
to previous. Could dismount and remount volume, to demonstrate no filesystem
caching is confusing the issue.

Show state of array.

Reattach USB stick--note detached device does not automatically reattach.

Tell mdadm to remove detached device, then readd same partition to array.

Add second disk partition to array as spare (not really “redundant”, since it’s on
same physical disk). Pull out USB stick again. Show how spare disk partition
automatically gets used in its place.
