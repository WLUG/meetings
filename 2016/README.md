## 2016-05-23 Clear Linux and Ubunt Mate 16.04

Trials and tribulations with Intel's Clear Linux (https://clearlinux.org/).

One week of using Ubuntu Mate 16.04 after years of Linux Mint - some experiences.

## [2016-06-27](2016-06-27) Systemd vs. SystemV

'systemd', which has replaced SYSTEMV 'init' in nearly ALL current Linux distributions, seems to go against the fundamental philosophy of Linux/Unix - Doug Mcllroy, the inventor of Unix pipes, summarized the Unix/Linux philosophy as follows: "This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well..." systemd has a 'finger-in-all-pies' approach & seems quite complex.

Let's discuss pros and cons of systemd.

## [2016-07-25](2016-07-25) X11 / Wayland / Mir, and Endless OS

X11 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System), the most common display server (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_server) on Linux, is showing its age. Newcomers, like Wayland (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)) and Mir (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_(software)) are trying to address shortcomings and provide a basis for the future.

Let's have a look at what each of the display servers' strengths and weaknesses are.

If you want to present one of them, then please let the organizer (Peter) know or post in the forum.

Ian Young will also demo Endless OS (https://endlessm.com/), an operating system that "comes with everything your family needs".
