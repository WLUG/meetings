## Distro Review

The meeting was spent reviewing some of the recently released distros.

This included a presentation by Ian Stewart on the Ubuntu Server distro. This server is
designed to be headless and managed via SSH login, etc. However, the *tasksel* application
may be used to add a GUI desktop. For more details please see the slide show:
