## [2021-03-22](2021-03-22) Processing Video and Audio

The Linux universe has a diverse set of applications for processing video and audio, using the command-line or a graphical user interface. Let's explore some of them.

Lawrence D'Oliveiro will demo the swiss-army knife ffmpeg and its associated tools.

Ian Stewart will show the MPV command-line video player, which is the basis for Celluloid (it replaced VLC in Ubuntu 20.04).

Peter Reutemann will introduce briefly OBS (Open Broadcaster Studio), OpenShot, PiTiVi, Handbrake, WinFF and Audacity.

## [2021-04-19](2021-04-19) Home Automation

Home automation (aka smart home) is now widely available through a range of consumer products. But often, these devices are only accessible through closed-source apps and also tend to "phone home". Let's have a look, together with Peter Reutemann, at Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io/), an open-source home automation framework that puts local control and privacy first.

## [2021-05-24](2021-05-24) Flavours of Linux

Ever been curious about Linux but never got around to giving it a go? Well, then you are in luck! In this meeting, we will help novices with having a test drive of Linux. Our members will bring different flavors of Linux along for you to try out. All you need is your laptop and a USB stick (4GB+) on which we can transfer a Linux image, from which you can then start a live Linux system.

Alternatively, you can also use VirtualBox.org (or similar virtualization software) to spin up a virtual machine with a particular Linux flavor on your laptop. And we can help you getting acquainted with it as well.

## 2021-06-28 Introduction to Git

New to the version control system git or wanting to share some handy tricks? Lawrence D'Oliveiro will give an introduction to the git command-line and how to manage files with it. After the intro, we will look into how to use github (e.g., forks, pull requests) and github alternatives.

Unfortunately, Lawrence can't make it tonight. So it will be a bit more ad-hoc than planned.

## 2021-07-26 Nextcloud

Looking for a replacement of Dropbox or Google Drive that respects your privacy? Then come to our meeting, as Glenn will show you how to install, run and use the open-source solution Nextcloud (https://nextcloud.com/) on a Raspberry Pi and check out the various clients that you can use with it.

## [2021-08-23](2021-08-23) Embedded BASIC scripts in LibreOffice
