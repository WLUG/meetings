Recently the Covid restrictions were eased. This allowed us to have our first *real* meeting at Waikato Uni room MS4.G.02 
after many months of *virtual* meetings using the NZOSS Big Blue Button web-conferencing system. 
At the same time this meeting was linked to BBB for on-line attendees.

# pfSense on FreeBSD using PC Engines hardware platform.

**Rubicon Communications LLC** do business with the trading name of **Netgate**. A major software product they develop is **pfSense®**.

The pfSense® Project is a free open source customized distribution of **FreeBSD** ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD ) 
tailored for use as a firewall and router entirely managed by an easy-to-use web interface. No FreeBSD knowledge is 
required to deploy and use pfSense software. In addition to being a powerful, flexible firewalling and routing platform, 
pfSense software includes a long list of related features. 

While pfSense is a product from Netgate https://www.netgate.com/pfsense-plus-software they offer a free-to-download 
Community Edition version: https://www.pfsense.org/download/


**Roger Hardy** delivered a presentation that involved the demonstration of pfSense. Netgate provide hardware for the 
FreeBSD/pfSense solution. Roger also displayed a suitable hardware platform from PC Engines.

As a follow-up to his presentation, Roger posted the following links...
