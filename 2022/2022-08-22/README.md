## Command-line tools under Linux

**Peter Reutemann** delivered a presentation on *Command-line tools under Linux*. 
They are the bread and butter of sysadmins, but any user can benefit from a wide 
variety of hidden gems. Peter explored essential command-line tools that one 
should be aware of.

## bash-help GUI

** Ian Stewart** presented his Python GUI programs that provide help for bash commands. 
The programs have an alphabetical tree view to aid selection of a bash command for 
which help is desired. Also a variation of the program contains a search window facility.
