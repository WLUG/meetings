# Bash Help GUI

**Ian Stewart** delivered a presentation of the python programs that he wrote that provide a
GUI interface for obtaining help on bash commands.

The presentation is in both .odp and .pdf formats:

* bash-help presentation.odp
* bash-help presentation.pdf


The python programs are available for both Gtk3 & Gtk4 and PyQt5 & PyQt6.

## Gtk3:

* bash-help-gui-gtk3.py
* bash-help-gui-gtk3-search.py

## Gtk4:
* bash-help-gui-gtk4.py
* bash-help-gui-gtk4-search.py

## PyQt5:

* bash-help-gui-qt5.py
* bash-help-gui-qt5-search.py

## PyQt6:

* bash-help-gui-qt6.py
* bash-help-gui-qt6-search.py

Note: The way the *subprocess* module from Python is used is not ideal. If improved methods of 
using *subprocess* are implemented then these files will be updated.
