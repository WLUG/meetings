People that never learned to touch type find that typing can severely impede creativity. Rod Aldridge will talk about his experience of getting Google's speech-to-text working on his computer to speed up his writing, what to look out for, how it works and how well it works.

[Peter Reutemann](gtk) will show a simple GTK interface for recording audio, sending it to a Coqui STT model running in a Docker container for transcription and then displaying the transcription in the user interface.
