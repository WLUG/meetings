Since we ran out of time at our last meeting, we are continuing our theme on cyber security with more show and tells (let Peter know if you would like to demo/present as well):

A far simpler firewall than pfSense, ufw (uncomplicated firewall), will be introduced by Peter (command-line and GUI). He will also briefly talk about tools like ClamAV (anti-virus), nmap (port scanner) and rkhunter (root kit detection). 

Some pointers:
* [ufw](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/introduction-uncomplicated-firewall-ufw/)
* [rkhunter](https://medium.com/@rkone1552000/rootkit-detection-chkrootkit-rkhunter-f52394116861) (development seems to have ceased)
* [clamav](https://datapioneer-network.org/index.php/2021/02/23/installing-using-clamav-in-linux/)
* [nmap](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-use-nmap-scanning-linux)


Angus will demo Wireguard, the VPN solution that made it into the Linux kernel (starting with 5.6).
