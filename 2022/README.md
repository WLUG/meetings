## 2022-04-26 Cyber Security

With increasing cyber security threats, it is high time that we look at how you can bolster the security of your Linux system and how you connect to the outside world. For this purpose, we will have short show and tells lined up (let Peter know if you would like to demo/present as well):

Roger will demo the pfSense firewall and router system based on FreeBSD, complete with a web-based user interface.
A far simpler firewall, ufw (uncomplicated firewall), will be introduced by Peter (command-line and GUI).
Angus will demo Wireguard, the VPN solutation that made it into the Linux kernel (starting with 5.6).

## 2022-05-23 Cyber Security - (Continued)

Since we ran out of time at our last meeting, we are continuing our theme on cyber security with more show and tells (let Peter know if you would like to demo/present as well):

A far simpler firewall than pfSense, ufw (uncomplicated firewall), will be introduced by Peter (command-line and GUI). He will also briefly talk about tools like ClamAV (anti-virus), nmap (port scanner) and rkhunter (root kit detection).
Angus will demo Wireguard, the VPN solution that made it into the Linux kernel (starting with 5.6).

## 2022-06-27 Installing Linux Mint 20 and Ubuntu 22.04

## 2022-07-25 Desktop Environments

Open source software is always about choice. Whereas Windows users can't really do much about the desktop experience that gets dictated by Microsoft, Linux users can choose from a wide variety of desktop environments. Tonight, we will explore a range of these: MATE, Cinnamon, Gnome, KDE, LXDE, XFCE and maybe more.

If your favorite environment is not listed, then please join in and demo it!

## 2022-08-22 Command Line Tools

Command-line tools under Linux are the bread and butter of sysadmins, but any user can benefit from a wide variety of hidden gems. In this meetup, we will explore essential command-line tools that one should be aware of. Please join us if you would to like learn about them or even demo your personal set of useful tools!

## 2022-09-27 Google's speech-to-text

People that never learned to touch type find that typing can severely impede creativity. Rod Aldridge will talk about his experience of getting Google's speech-to-text working on his computer to speed up his writing, what to look out for, how it works and how well it works.

## 2022-10-25 Docker

Ever wondered what Docker was all about? Peter Reutemann will give a hands-on introduction into the tool and show you why it is so useful.

## 2022-11-28 Window Managers for Linux

Gnome, MATE, Cinnamon and KDE are the most common window managers for Linux desktops. But what about the lesser known ones? There are plenty of compositing, stacking or tiling window managers out there. Let's have a look at some (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_window_managers). Maybe you'll find the one that you have been looking for all those years?
