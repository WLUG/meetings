# Meetings for 2020

## 2020-01-20 LineageOS

Is your Android phone no longer supported by your manufacturer? Then you might able to update it using a custom ROM from LineageOS (https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/) or AospExtended ROM (https://www.aospextended.com/devices/pie). Peter Reutemann will show the process of updating the ROM on an Android phone.

## 2020-02-24 Pinebook Pro

Michael Cree will demo his Pinebook Pro and talk about his experiences with it, as well as challenges that he has (or still has to) overcome.

## 2020-03-23 Naomi Project

The voice interface represents another big shift in user interfaces, and could be as big a shift as the shift from switches to terminals, the switch from terminals to windowed GUIs, or the switch from full computers to small touchscreen devices.

Unfortunately, right now most of these devices are little more than a telephone for talking to a server in the cloud. That is a big problem for privacy, and presents the user with a false choice between access and privacy. Today's computers are capable of handling a verbal interface without requiring a cloud service to handle all of your requests.

Aaron Chantrill is one of the developers on the Naomi Project, a free and open source voice assistant (https://projectnaomi.com). It is a plugin based system based on Jasper (http://jasperproject.github.io/), and depending on how the user chooses to configure it, can run totally offline.

In this presentation, Aaron would like to introduce people to the Naomi Project, talk about the benefits of a verbal interface, talk about the current architectures of virtual assistants, and ways in which that architecture can be altered to provide better privacy, and also do a comparison of offline speech to text and text to speech solutions, including Pocketsphinx, Mozilla Deepspeech, Kaldi, and Julius. Finally, He will invite people to participate in building and improving Naomi. There is a lot to do and much of it is both engaging and cutting-edge.

Aaron recorded a video of his presentation that you can watch:

## 2020-04-20 Gentoo and Arch

Debian or Debian-based systems like Ubuntu and Linux Mint seem to be everywhere nowadays. However, there are other distros around, also with active communities.

Jake Pouw-Waas will give a short introduction to Gentoo: Portage software management, the heart of Gentoo. In his talk, he will cover actions like searching and installing packages, updating and patching, as well as how to use other package sources and create your own ones.

Angus will give a similar overview of Arch Linux, discussing how a rolling release distribution works, the Pacman package manager and the Arch User Repository.

## 2020-05-25 Ubuntu 20.04 and Manjaro

Let's have a look at some non-Windows distributions:

* Ian Stewart: Ubuntu 20.04
* Rod Aldridge/Peter Reutemann: Manjaro

We will be using the BigBlueButton instance, kindly made available by the NZ Open-Source Society, for this "virtual" meeting (max. 45 attendees). You can join the meeting at the following URL (please use your full name, as attendance will require moderator approval):

In order to avoid interruptions, the actual presentations will start at 7:45pm. This will give us 15min to log in and configure our audio/video settings properly (and have a bit of a chat as well).

## 2020-06-22 GhostBSD and EndeavourOS Distros

Continuing with last month's Linux distribution showdown, we are having a look at these:

Tom Butz will show off GhostBSD, a BSD with a graphical user interface
    
Peter Reutemann will give his account on converting his laptop to Arch (through EndeavourOS)

## 2020-07-27 Docker and DRM with TVNZ

Peter Reutemann will give an intro to Docker (https://www.docker.com/) and how he uses it to containerize deep learning frameworks.

Tom Butz will briefly talk about his experience of DRM with TVNZ.

## 2020-08-24 WireGuard VPN

With VPNs being in the news frequently (and often for sad reasons like selling logs despite assurances that no such logs would exist), let's have a hands-on session with WireGuard (https://www.wireguard.com/), a VPN tunnel that is easier to use and configure than IPSec and faster than OpenVPN.

## 2020-09-28 BASH Programming

Together, let's delve a bit into bash programming and command-line utilities that you can use in your scripts.

## 2020-10-19 Blockchain in XML and Ubuntu online upgrade

Jake Waas will present a straightforward blockchain consisting of XML,
conveniently viewable with a web browser. The miner / archival node is
implemented in steel bank common lisp. Several important TODOs include the having of more than one node, defining a smart contract XML and using GPG signing. We can see the basic structure of a blockchain, and consider how and why they are useful. Hopefully he can learn something to add to his blockchain too!

Ian Stewart will talk about his experience of performing an online upgrade of Ubuntu 18.04.5 to 20.04.1.

## 2020-11-23 LISP Programming Language

Introduction to the LISP programming language will be presented by Jake Waas and Ian Stewart. They will focus on the open source CLISP and SBCL dialects of the LISP language and the use of functions in the COMMON-LISP package. By the end of the presentation you will be able to write simple LISP programs.
