As part of the presentation a collection of demonstration lisp program files are provided. These files are:

* demo_1.lisp
* demo_print.lisp
* demo_format.lisp

* demo_radio.lisp

As an appendix to the presentation one slide was added to demonstate how the *apropos* and *apropos-list* functions are helpful in finding the functions that are available. Ian also wrote a program that is helpful in displaying all the symbols that are part of a package. This progam is included as:

* package-symbols.lisp

Lawrence D'Oliverio experimented with Jupyter notebook running LISP code through its “%%script” cell magic. Please launch $ jupyter-notebook and then open the file:
