# LISP

## An Introduction to LISP Using the compilers conforming to Common Lisp of: 
## Steel Bank Common Lisp ~ SBCL & CLISP

Ian Stewart and Jake Waas delivered the presentation which is available in .odp or .pdf formats:

* lisp_presentation.odp
* lisp_presentation.pdf

As part of the presentation a collection of demonstration lisp program files are provided. These files are:

* demo_1.lisp
* demo_print.lisp
* demo_format.lisp
* demo_input.lisp
* demo_radio.lisp
* demo_2.lisp
* demo_math.lisp
* demo_trig.lisp
* demo_date.lisp
* demo_file.lisp

As an appendix to the presentation one slide was added to demonstate how the *apropos* and *apropos-list* functions are helpful in finding the functions that are available. Ian also wrote a program that is helpful in displaying all the symbols that are part of a package. This progam is included as:

* package-symbols.lisp

The last slide of the presentation provides a list of some aspects of LISP that were not covered in the presentation. It is intended that these items will be covered at a future meeting. In the meantime, for those who have decided to explore programming in LISP, it is worthwhile to learn and understand some additional concepts. Jake has written the following three programs to highlight features of these concepts:

* 0-let-setf-lambda.lisp
* 1-lists.lisp
* 2-closures.lisp

Lawrence D'Oliveiro experimented with Jupyter notebook running LISP code through its “%%script” cell magic. Please launch `$ jupyter-notebook` and then open the file:
