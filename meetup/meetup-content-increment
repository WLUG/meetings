David M.~

Sounds great. A couple of little requests:
1. Explanation of the Android file/directory tree and related storage conventions
2. A quick tour through a "Hello, world" app, starting off with simple text display, then adding a couple of widgets eg an input field, a button to send that input to a web app, an output field to display the result.

Sione.~

Looking forward to this

Peter R.~

Interesting talk by Lawrence. Finally got an intro to Android. Great to see new faces as well!

Chris O.~

Informative and showed a number of the steps for starting off creating an Android app.

Sione.~

Thanks Lawrence for sharing the Android build process. Also good to see other Linux users. Looking forward to future meetings.

Godot Game Engine and Manjaro

Details

William McKee is demoing the Godot Game Engine (http://www.godotengine.org/wp/), released under the MIT license. Similar to Unity3D (http://unity3d.com/) in features, it provides tools to quickly create games under Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.

Ian Young will give a quick run-down of the Manjaro (http://manjaro.org/) distribution.

Comments

Peter R.~

Due to illness of speaker, the presentation was moved to June.

John T.~

Hey people,
How do I transcode a mp4 to .ts so it can be played on tv???

Elroy L.~

Apologies, work commitments.

Peter R.~

Very good turnout with plenty of first timers. Interesting demonstration of Manjaro Linux (XFCE) and funky demo of Godot game engine.

William M.~

Great meetup - lots of people i hadn't met before.
Great to finally get the 'waiting for godot' talk out of the way. I hope people enjoyed it, and i would love to hear any success from it :)
cheers, william

Chris O.~

After the meeting, I shifted the godot executable into /usr/local/bin and then ran it using optirun godot . This turned on my laptop's Nvidia card to accelerate the graphics. The performance was even slicker then.

Andrew P.~

It was awesome! I did not see so many people which are really into computers for a lot of years :-)

Yubikey

Details

The Yubikey is one time password generator that conveniently connects a USB keyboard to your PC. It is port powered and small enough to kept on your keyring [1].

The Yubikey uses Yubico's authentication server and can be used conveniently with Lastpass.com to provide two factor authentication to your online password vault. Third parties have written yubikey authentication mechanisms to secure restricted access to Apache webservers. There are many other applications and there are alternative hardware yubikeys capable of connection to smart phones.

The authentication server technology is open source allowing users to create their own authentication servers. Yubico provides their service for free. At roughly $US25 a key, the technology is very competitively priced (cf RSA tokens) and well within the price range of most enthusiasts. Unfortunately, Google doesn't (yet) provide it as an option for their two factor authentication.

The presenter will talk about lastpass.com and apache authentication.

[1] https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey/

Comments

Chris O.~

I should have been more accurate. You can sort of hack your yubikey to do two factor authentication with Gmail but it's certainly not out of the box.

Maybe if I get it going, it could be another thing to present.

Chris O.~

An update. I have figured out two factor authentication using the yubikey for google accounts.

Eric L.~

I was given a YubiKey as part of the delegate pack at LCA2011. It's been sitting there waiting for me to make use of it for years. Super keen to see it in action :)

Chris O.~

I know you weren't able to make the presentation but have you tried using it yet?

Eric L.~

Yeah, GUTTED that I missed it. Had the day pile up on me :)

I can't even FIND my Yubikey at the moment. I'm relatively certain it's within five metres of my current location. But no, I never tried actually putting it to use.

Blender

Details

3D animations (or CGI) are everywhere nowadays. You don't need deep pockets for purchasing good software, the FLOSS world has its own package for creating first-class animations: Blender (http://www.blender.org/).

Lawrence D'Oliveiro will give a hands-on demonstration on how to use Blender, introduce you to the basics and show how to create simple animations. He will also present some of the animations that he created over the years.

Comments

Lawrence D.~

I’m wondering whether to suggest that, if anyone has their own machine with a suitably-recent version of Blender installed, to bring it and maybe follow along some of the demonstrations I plan to do.

Peter R.~

Sounds like a good idea!

John T.~

Hi lawrence,
I have a desktop with Blender installed and would like to do as you suggest but you will need to talk very slowly and use small words for me to understand you...

Bryan H.~

Still living in Whakatane, so won't be able to make it this time around... Hopefully next time!

Elroy L.~

Sick :(

Peter R.~

Very cool Blender demo. A pro like Lawrence makes it look so easy! But even a noob can see the potential that Blender offers. Well done!

Peter R.~

Very cool Blender demo. A pro like Lawrence makes it look so easy! But even a noob can see the potential that Blender offers. Well done!

Docker 

Details

Virtualization has been become commonplace nowadays, with lots of different implementations. Docker (https://www.docker.com/) provides an as-thin-as-possible approach, making use of the kernel's functionality of resource isolation, eliminating the need for installing an operating system for the guest system.

Andrew Parnasov will give an introduction to Docker, how to set it up, how to use and what it can be used for.

Comments

Elroy L.~

Sorry guys, work commitments

Peter R.~

Really cool to see how Docker works. Much like git for virtualization.

Android x86, Puppy Linux, and Testing Techniques

Details

The year starts with a look at not-so-common Linux distributions.

Ian Young: Android x86 project (http://www.android-x86.org/) and Puppy Linux (http://puppylinux.org/).

Baden Delamore: brief demos of some of the
tools and penetration testing techniques available through Kali (https://www.kali.org/).

Comments

Peter R.~

I was only able to attend the first part on Kali. Eye opening and scary at the same time.

Chris O.~

Thanks Baden for an introductory and eye-opening talk. If you're keen, I think a Part 2 would be well received.
Thanks too to Ian for persevering with the technical difficulties of the projector.

Raspberry Pi 2 and BeagleBone

Details

Andrew Crosby: Raspberry Pi 2 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) demo, what's new, what's hot.

Michael Cree: BeagleBone (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeagleBoard#BeagleBone) demo, consisting of general introduction of the BeagleBone and on using it for interfacing with an inertial measurement unit (IMU).

Comments

Peter R.~

Excellent talks. Refreshing to see very low-level, hardware stuff being presented. Linux maybe a breeze on the Desktop, but embedded is still a lot of tinkering involved.

Chris O.~

I'd like to add my thanks to the presenters for demonstrating their knowledge of the two ARM based devices. Two really interesting talks but as Peter said below, still quite a bit of tinkering to get some things to work.

===

2015-04-27

Security

Details

Due to the positive feedback on Baden Delamore's demonstration of Kali (https://www.kali.org/) back in February, there will be a follow up to, delving deeper into the world of (in-)security.

git (https://www.git-scm.com/) - from novice to master. Lawrence D'Oliveiro will introduce you to the distributed revision control system git, demonstrating the basic commands and also more advanced actions.

Comments

Lawrence D.~

I thought I was going to be on in July!

Peter R.~

Sorry, that was my fault. Forgot that we still had a meeting in May. Would you be able to do it next week? Otherwise I reschedule for July and we'll just have social meeting and maybe some disto roundup next week.

Lawrence D.~

Yes, I can do a presentation on Monday. Will the audience already be familiar with version control systems? Otherwise I can introduce the concept.

Chris O.~

Thanks Lawrence for your talk and for the following tip.
git add -p

Tony T.~

Chat at the Cook

Details

It is time to do what many other meetups usually do: meet at a pub and have a chat over a drink! Let's all go to The Cook (upstairs) and talk all things Linux.

No matter whether you are new to Linux or even never heard of it but would like to know more about it, feel free to stop by and say hi.

Comments

Lawrence D.~

Nice, cosy venue for the Python event we had there recently. Looking forward to another pleasant evening.

Peter R.~

Bit noisy surroundings due to pub quiz, but with power socket available, even a Linux installation could be pulled off. Great environment to have interesting conversations.

Chris O.~

Sorry I couldn't make it. I was hoping to come but we've got lots on at present and then the cat decided to get sick again.

Peter R.~

No problem. Hopefully, we'll see you next time!

Terminal Server Project and Linux Mint

Details

Ian Stewart will talk about the Linux Terminal Server Project (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Terminal_Server_Project) (LTSP) and how to connect to it using thin clients (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client) and RaspberryPi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi).

Peter Reutemann will give the new Linux Mint (http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2864) release a quick spin.

Comments

Lawrence D.~

If there is a moment, Rod Aldridge and I would like to raise the issue of what’s happening (or not happening) with the computer lab at Te Whare O Te Ata, and see if anyone has any ideas that might help.

John T.~

I think it rather critical that the parents/caregivers of the target market have a LARGE assurance that their ( vunerable ) children are not going to be preyed upon. I can probably help to some degree but have some real reservations on how that can happen. Particularly as many computer experts come across as " a little strange". Repeat .. I am willing to help. but not sure how....

Peter R.~

Great demo by Ian, as always. Cool to see Raspberry Pi working as a thin client, hooked up to LTSP server.

William M.~

The script I was telling you about : https://github.com/jbradforddillon/instant-api-py

Raspberry Pi and TAILS

Details

Hieu Trinh will talk about how to use a Raspberry Pi for sorting fruit.

Ian Stewart will bring along the new TAILS (https://tails.boum.org/) (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) 1.5 release.

General discussion on email encryption (incl signing) and network privacy.

Comments

John T.~

Had eye surgery on Weds 23/9/15 so there is a fair to average chance I will be able to see everyone/thing clearly....

Peter R.~

Hieu's talk on using the RPI for blueberry sorting was great. Amazing what kind of projects you can use the little one for! Ian's TAILS demo was, as usual, very interactive and the audience was very involved. Good stuff! Unfortunately, I had to leave early.

Chris O.~

Sorry to miss the talk. Family not well.

William M.~

Sorry to miss this - my trip to Levin was extended. Next month.

Also here's some ideas for future talks:

svg. I've been watching cssconf videos and it's quite inspiring what can be done nowadays. Worth watching this keynote from cssconfau (a conference which would be super cool to come to nz or at least have it every 5 years in nz like lca) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMFfTRiipOQ

Unity3d. They recently released Unity3d for Linux. http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/08/26/unity-comes-to-linux-experimental-build-now-available/. I have this running, it works great but regular crashes are a pain.

Clear Linux and Ubunt Mate 16.04

Details

Trials and tribulations with Intel's Clear Linux (https://clearlinux.org/).

One week of using Ubuntu Mate 16.04 after years of Linux Mint - some experiences.

Comments

Peter R.~

Great to see new faces. Lively discussion on Clear Linux, especially when the update failed. Ubuntu 16.04 is simply a steady distribution, despite Glade eating up all your memory.

Bruce G.~

I'm not into "cloud-computing", but it was interesting to hear about & maybe get a little insight as to where it might lead...I can see the advantage of it for commercial & scientific purposes, but I have horrifying visions of where it may lead to for the dumbed-down consumer...

John T.~

Ian gave me a live usb for clear Linux to try on my amd machine. Result was a fail of epic proportions after several error messages about cpu not supported or intel............. locked at login screen (console)

Systemd vs. SystemV

Details

'systemd', which has replaced SYSTEMV 'init' in nearly ALL current Linux distributions, seems to go against the fundamental philosophy of Linux/Unix - Doug Mcllroy, the inventor of Unix pipes, summarized the Unix/Linux philosophy as follows: "This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well..." systemd has a 'finger-in-all-pies' approach & seems quite complex.

Let's discuss pros and cons of systemd.

Comments

Bruce G.~

What do YOU think?...or has the fluoridated water made you totally complacent? :-P

Lawrence D.~

Does the Linux kernel “do one thing, and do it well”?

Does the X11 server “do one thing, and do it well”?

“man bash” outputs a text that is over 5000 lines long. Does bash “do one thing, and do it well”?

Bruce G.~

Lawrence - just because a system already has problems - we should not stand by and enable MORE problems to be added?

Bruce G.~

Re: "bash" - Debian now ships with "Dash", a considerably smaller shell...also there are others - I personally like "fish" = the "fRIENDLY iNTERACTIVE shELL"

William M.~

Hard of xonsh? Talk at pycon2016. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaje5I22kgE Crowd loved it.

William M.~

There is no stopping systemd. I have no choice.

Bruce G.~

Check out "Devuan"

Bruce G.~

http://devuan.org/

William M.~

Thanks Bruce, I do know about Devuan. May have to give it a go :)

Lawrence D.~

I see a number of not-quite-responses to my questions that dodge my actual point: that the fond idea that the Linux environment consists primarily of a bunch of lightweight components that “do one thing, and do it well” is a half-truth. The reality is that there are a whole host of much more heavyweight components that have to do many things, in order to provide the environment in which these lighter-weight components can exist. One could not operate without the other.

We saw this in the early days of the Linux kernel itself, when it was criticized for not being a small, modular microkernel. Yet, today, the microkernel concept remains as marginal as ever, while the entire computing world--even Microsoft--seems to be converging on Linux.

And yet some insist on repeating history for its own sake, again resorting to subjective and emotional arguments, rather than rational, technical ones.

So enough with the arbitrary and selective derogations of these heavyweight components, OK?

William M.~

Looking forward to your talk on this Lawrence.....


William M.~

Excellent meetup as always. I enjoyed giving a few of the commands Lawrence demoed a go.

X11 / Wayland / Mir, and Endless OS

Details

X11 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System), the most common display server (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_server) on Linux, is showing its age. Newcomers, like Wayland (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)) and Mir (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_(software)) are trying to address shortcomings and provide a basis for the future.

Let's have a look at what each of the display servers' strengths and weaknesses are.

If you want to present one of them, then please let the organizer (Peter) know or post in the forum.

Ian Young will also demo Endless OS (https://endlessm.com/), an operating system that "comes with everything your family needs".

Comments

William M.~

It was great to hear about endless os from Ian. Something similar built with rasbian would be neat. Would add blender and scribus to it also.

Thanks peter for talking about Wayland and mir.

Quite a decent turnout - I counted 16 people.

Peter R.~

Excellent group effort to discuss Wayland and Mir, due to lack of volunteers. Endless OS demo was quite interesting, too. Very polished distro!

John T.~

Good meeting. Looks to me like Wayland may have a few hoops to jump yet. Liked the Endless OS but would like to be able to see what is happening during update/upgrades via cli or some other means rather than a spinning cursor..

Introduction to Linux

Details

An introduction to Linux - features, history, examples of popular flavors (Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc) and user interfaces (MATE, Gnome3, KDE, Unity, etc).

Advantages and disadvantages to Windows.

Presenters:

* William Mckee: History
* Peter Reutemann: MATE and XFCE
* Rowan Schischka: Gnome3 and Unity
* Lawrence D'Oliveiro: KDE
* John Thompson: Frustrations and delights as a disgruntled Windows 9x user.

Comments

Peter R.~

Good idea. Who's willing to take on a part of this meeting? history, features, examples, advantages?

William M.~

I would be willing to create some slides and talk about the history. It's something I haven't really talked about in the past and would enjoy researching the history. Would like feedback on my slides before the talk.

Peter R.~

That should be fine, as long as it is at least a week beforehand. :-)

William M.~

ok, i will have a think about it and let you know at next wlug meeting. I am ok with making slides but not so keen on speaking. Might be best if someone else does it. Guess something to talk about at next wlug meeting.

John T.~

post script. Started on Fedora Core 4 then shifted around a large number of the available distributions including Suse before settling on Ubuntu

Peter R.~

Do you want to demo Fedora and SuSE then? Just a couple of minutes each to show what it looks like, what kind of management tools are on offer, etc.

John T.~

Wow! that was a really long time ago now. I have a few recollections of the likes/ not too sure what to do next in three of the systems but would be unable to demo them confidently..

Peter R.~

No worries.

Peter R.~

Nice history on Linux by William, very lively presentations, excellent live demos with lots of questions asked and answered.

Blender, Dia, Inkscape, and GIMP

Details

Let's show off what applications you can use on Linux for multi-media task:

* Lawrence D'Oliveiro - using Blender (https://www.blender.org/) for creating 3D animations and Jack (http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/) for music/audio production.

* Peter Reutemann - using Dia (http://dia-installer.de/index.html.en) for creating flow charts and diagrams.

* William Mckee - Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/en/) (vector drawing and text), Sozi (http://sozi.baierouge.fr/pages/10-about.html) (slide deck extension), Scribus (https://www.scribus.net/) (book design) .

* Ian Stewart - a glimpse at what GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/), the image manipulation program, can do.

If you are looking for alternatives for programs, give alternativeto.net (http://alternativeto.net/) a go. Quite a good source for finding open-source equivalents of proprietary programs.

Comments

Peter R.~

Really cool Blender and Jack audio demo by Lawrence. Has been a while I've seen a venerable Korg keyboard - but great to see MIDI still alive and kicking (or drumming!). Demo of Inkscape/Sozi by William showed off what you can do with SVG in terms of very cool presentation style animations. Ian's presentation gave us a glimpse of the vast toolkit that is called Gimp. Really enjoyed the evening!

John T.~

Yes! Sorry I missed it. I chose to Park in Auckland's peak time traffic instead. A really poor choice.:(

William M.~

Great talk by Peter on Dia. Especially with the electronics diagram - something to mention to my Sister. Nice suprise to see the demo of RecordMyDesktop - something I use to record my time lapses. Inkscape was a popular topic - demos of it from myself, Lawrence and Peter. Thanks Ian for showing GIMP - always good to see others using it.

* President's Report
* Treasurer's Report
* Election of 2017 Committee
* General business (eg future of WLUG library, wording in the charter with regard to advertising of jobs using the wlug mailing list, etc)
* Consumption of pizza

Comments

Lawrence D.~

We also need to decide on the disposition of the library. Chris doesn’t want to keep storing it any more, and I think it has become obsolete anyway.

Peter R.~

Good point. Just updated the agenda.

Ian S.~

As part of the General Business, I propose we discuss enhancing the wording in the charter with regard to advertising of jobs using the wlug mailing list.

General discussion on backup tools and strategies: What tool do you use? What approach is working for you? What should you stay away from at all costs?

Comments

Peter R.~

Great introduction to Manjaro by Ian Y. Looks like a distro that I could live with. Good and lively discussion on backups and what other people use. Many use rsync. :-)

===

2018-03-26

Rsync

Details

Due to the lively discussion around backup at last month's meeting, we decided to delve a bit deeper into backups using rsync (https://rsync.samba.org/).

Lawrence D'Oliveiro will give an introduction to rsync and some of its very useful options. Combining rsync with ionice and badblocks, you can ensure that your backup doesn't slow down your system and is in a consistent state.

Peter Reutemann will give a short overview of some of the user interfaces for rsync, making life easier for the less command-line savvy users among us.

Angus will show how to use encryption to ensure that your backup files are secure from prying eyes.

Time permitting: Lawrence and Ian will bring along a 3D printer, and present its hardware design and the printers software that runs on Linux.

Free Open Source Software

Details

John Thompson, is a trucker who got rattled with Windows 98x
eighteen+ years ago. Spent a few frustrating years trying to understand

Naomi Project

Details

The voice interface represents another big shift in user interfaces, and could be as big a shift as the shift from switches to terminals, the switch from terminals to windowed GUIs, or the switch from full computers to small touchscreen devices.

Unfortunately, right now most of these devices are little more than a telephone for talking to a server in the cloud. That is a big problem for privacy, and presents the user with a false choice between access and privacy. Today's computers are capable of handling a verbal interface without requiring a cloud service to handle all of your requests.

Aaron Chantrill is one of the developers on the Naomi Project, a free and open source voice assistant (https://projectnaomi.com). It is a plugin based system based on Jasper (http://jasperproject.github.io/), and depending on how the user chooses to configure it, can run totally offline.

In this presentation, Aaron would like to introduce people to the Naomi Project, talk about the benefits of a verbal interface, talk about the current architectures of virtual assistants, and ways in which that architecture can be altered to provide better privacy, and also do a comparison of offline speech to text and text to speech solutions, including Pocketsphinx, Mozilla Deepspeech, Kaldi, and Julius. Finally, He will invite people to participate in building and improving Naomi. There is a lot to do and much of it is both engaging and cutting-edge.

Aaron recorded a video of his presentation that you can watch:
https://youtu.be/8383A_t7iKQ

The slides are available as well:

Blockchain in XML and Ubuntu online upgrade

Details

Jake Waas will present a straightforward blockchain consisting of XML,
conveniently viewable with a web browser. The miner / archival node is
implemented in steel bank common lisp. Several important TODOs include the having of more than one node, defining a smart contract XML and using GPG signing. We can see the basic structure of a blockchain, and consider how and why they are useful. Hopefully he can learn something to add to his blockchain too!

Home Automation

Details

Home automation (aka smart home) is now widely available through a range of consumer products. But often, these devices are only accessible through closed-source apps and also tend to "phone home". Let's have a look, together with Peter Reutemann, at Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io/), an open-source home automation framework that puts local control and privacy first.

Flavours of Linux

Details

Ever been curious about Linux but never got around to giving it a go? Well, then you are in luck! In this meeting, we will help novices with having a test drive of Linux. Our members will bring different flavors of Linux along for you to try out. All you need is your laptop and a USB stick (4GB+) on which we can transfer a Linux image, from which you can then start a live Linux system.

Alternatively, you can also use VirtualBox.org (or similar virtualization software) to spin up a virtual machine with a particular Linux flavor on your laptop. And we can help you getting acquainted with it as well.

With the lockdown extended till at least Tuesday, we will have a virtual one instead.
Now's your chance to list your topic of choice. :-)
Stay safe everyone!

Hippie H.~

ii.nz is doing some fun stuff, and doing a weekly meetup in Tauranga.

Some of which is CloudNative.NZ related, but more broadly Open Source / Open Society style inclusion of non-technically focused folks.

Might be fun to chat about that some! Also keen to see BigBlueButton in use!

I can't get the sound on my laptop to work, so I will have to give it a miss.

Window Managers for Linux

Details

Gnome, MATE, Cinnamon and KDE are the most common window managers for Linux desktops. But what about the lesser known ones? There are plenty of compositing, stacking or tiling window managers out there. Let's have a look at some (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_window_managers). Maybe you'll find the one that you have been looking for all those years?

BTW After nearly 10 years I won't be standing for president (or any other office) anymore. Due to personal reasons, I can no longer give the president's office the required attention (like organizing meetings, finding speakers/topics, presenting, etc).
This presents a great opportunity for someone new to step up and bring in a fresh perspective to the society!
