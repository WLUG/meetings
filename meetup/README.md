From 2014 to 2023 WLUG made use of **meetup.com** to promote meetings. The raw data from meetup has been captured as a text file.

* **meetup-content-increment** is the raw meetup data file containing date, title, details and comments.
* **meetup_extract.py** is python code used to extract data and create .md file, etc. from the meetup-content-increment file.
