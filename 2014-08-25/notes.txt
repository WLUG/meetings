Ensure key-mon is installed to let audience see my clicks & keystrokes
Change modifier key for System Settings→Window Behavior→Window Actions from Alt to Meta.

What to cover:

    Blender covers every major area of 3D production work: modelling, sculpting,
    animation, rendering, physical modelling, even compositing and video editing.
UI intro
    windowing system--needs to run full-screen
    different kinds of windows, window headers, editor-selection menu, window layouts
    just briefly mention scenes: like multiple documents-within-a-document
    left-click (place current point) versus middle-click (adjust view) versus right-click (select things)
    introduce 3D view
        middle-mouse and shift-middle-mouse to change view
    introduce Properties window
        show how object-specific properties change depending on selection
    briefly mention other windows in Default layout: outliner, timeline
    Blender UI is designed to minimize interruptions to workflow (avoid popups)
        object→action→settings, e.g. “Quick Fur” effect applied to default cube
    object mode vs edit mode on default cube
    some keyboard shortcuts: A, G, S, R
    introduce Cartesian coordinate systems
    G/S/R axis constraints
    Blender uses local vs global coords, choice of G/S/R axis constraints,
        transformation in object vs edit modes
features intro
    modelling a simple goblet from hex prism:
        create prism as cylinder, set sides to 6 (action→settings)
        explanation about edge loops and loop cuts
            (note loop doesn’t continue past poles on end faces)
        symmetrical scaling (just one of the ways to produce a radially-symmetrical model)
        add subsurf modifier (explain about modifiers),
        demonstrate curvature control with loop spacing
        also smooth shading versus cranking up the subsurf levels
    demonstrate BI materials, diffuse vs specular, metal vs plastic
    add some surround (e.g. floor + array of plain cubes) for reflection/refraction
    first render: note rear side is inky black: add environment lighting, second light
    ray-tracing refraction & reflection
    give background cubes array an emissive material, show how this doesn’t
        illuminate non-raytraced goblet in BI
    switch to Cycles render, note how this loses almost all material settings
    demonstrate Cycles materials nodes
    have time for some physical modelling? Smoke and flames might be enough
    basic animation? (might not have time) (but Peter’s meeting blurb promised animations!)
        concept of key frames
        animating properties vs animating transforms in 3D view
Python scripting
    Blender has a DOM
    show interactively adjusting transformation of default cube
samples
    take some .blend files of mine, show corresponding rendered videos from Vimeo:
        Spy Ring Game Board (low-poly example, BI example)
        Abdul Jalil House (point out “reversed shadows” next to carport pillars)
            need a copy of .blend file with mesh fence hidden for faster opening?
            Or just show slow opening as example of what you have to deal with in 3D
        UFO Moonbase Control Sphere
        UFO Moonbase exterior
        Futuro House
    maybe end with a Blender Foundation movie. Or a Caminandes one?
        Sintel: mocap, hair
        Tears Of Steel: match-move and green-screening
