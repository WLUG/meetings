Meeting 2014-07-28
==================

The Yubikey is one time password generator that conveniently connects a USB
keyboard to your PC. It is port powered and small enough to kept on your
keyring [1].

The Yubikey uses Yubico's authentication server and can be used conveniently
with Lastpass.com to provide two factor authentication to your online password
vault. Third parties have written yubikey authentication mechanisms to secure
restricted access to Apache webservers. There are many other applications and
there are alternative hardware yubikeys capable of connection to smart phones.

The authentication server technology is open source allowing users to create
their own authentication servers. Yubico provides their service for free. At
roughly $US25 a key, the technology is very competitively priced (cf RSA
tokens) and well within the price range of most enthusiasts. Unfortunately,
Google doesn't (yet) provide it as an option for their two factor
authentication.

The presenter will talk about lastpass.com and apache authentication.
